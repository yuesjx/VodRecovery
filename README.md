# VodRecovery
* The purpose of this script is to obtain videos or clips that are either marked as "sub-only" or have been deleted on Twitch. 

# About
* Developed by: Shishkebaboo (formerly ItIckeYd)
* Initial release: May 3rd, 2022
* The script leverages logic from the [TwitchRecover](https://github.com/TwitchRecover/TwitchRecover) repository developed by [Daylam Tayari](https://github.com/daylamtayari)

# Features
* Supports both manual and website vod recovery
* Can recover vods individually or in bulk using a CSV downloaded from [Sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/)
* Can recover clips manually or in bulk using a CSV from [Sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/)
* Supports downloading M3U8 links/files, with the ability to specify start/end timestamps for trimmed vods using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
* Compatible with [TwitchTracker](https://twitchtracker.com/), [Sullygnome](https://sullygnome.com/), and [Streamscharts](https://streamscharts.com/)
* Uses UTC timezone as default for recovering vods
* Notifies if vod is older than 60 days (due to Twitch's deletion process)
